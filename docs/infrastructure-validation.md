## 🔧 Infrastructure Configuration Files

### Required Files Status
- [x] `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- [x] `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- [x] `tailwind.config.js` - Styling configuration
- [x] `.env.example` - Environment template
- [ ] `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- [ ] `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` - Local development

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional - for production
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id
VITE_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Infrastructure

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production monitoring
   - Implement automated testing
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)

2. **Short-term Goals**
   - Add caching layer (Redis)
   - Implement CDN for assets
   - Set up analytics platform
   - Create operational runbooks

3. **Long-term Roadmap**
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Advanced monitoring dashboard
   - ML infrastructure for recommendations
   - Real-time analytics pipeline

## 📊 Infrastructure Metrics Targets

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Performance**: <3s page load, <200ms API
- **Scalability**: Support 10,000 concurrent users
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Cost**: <$500/month at current scale

## 🔍 Validation Commands

```bash
# Check build
npm run build

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Test local deployment
npm run preview

# Check bundle size
npm run build && npm run analyze

# Verify environment
node -e "console.log(process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL ? 'Environment configured' : 'Environment missing')"
```
