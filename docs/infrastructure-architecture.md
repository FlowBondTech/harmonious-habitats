# Holistic Wellness Community Platform Infrastructure Architecture

## Infrastructure Overview

- **Cloud Provider:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime) with Vercel for hosting
- **Core Services:** Supabase Database, Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage, Supabase Realtime, Vercel Edge Network
- **Regional Architecture:** Multi-region with primary in US East, automatic edge distribution via Vercel
- **Multi-environment Strategy:** Development (local), Staging (preview deployments), Production (main branch)

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- **Tools & Frameworks**
  - Supabase CLI for database migrations and schema management
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
  - Vercel CLI for deployment configuration
  - Environment variables managed via Vercel dashboard

- **Repository Structure**
  ```
  /
  ├── supabase/
  │   ├── migrations/     # SQL schema migrations
  │   ├── functions/      # Edge functions (future)
  │   └── config.toml     # Supabase configuration
  ├── .github/
  │   └── workflows/      # CI/CD pipelines
  └── vercel.json         # Vercel configuration
  ```
